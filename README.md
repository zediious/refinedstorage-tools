**Requires Java 17!**

To use this tool, download the latest release, and run the jar file with the command line;

`java -jar <jar file name>`

The `refinedstorage_nodes.dat` file you wish to use must be in the same directory.

This tool is a constant work in progress, as well as a learning experience for me. Feel free to offer any suggestions in the form of an Issue and/or PR.
